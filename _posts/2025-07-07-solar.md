## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5

## Review Summary
Reptile is away on a co-op and is taking ECE493 remotely. Meets with me
regularly and has amazing progress updates. But will quietly whine about grading policy each time!

## Detailed Breakdown

- **Learning Style:** Always comes prepared with questions. Questions, questions, and more question!
- **Grades:** Must be 100/100 or he is a failure to reptilian brotherhood.
- **Industriousness:** Seems to burrow all night long and is yawning during 1:1 meetings. Get some sleep, reptile!
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** Rallies the troops and will commetn on all Piazza posts like a true reptile!
- **Reptile Quality:** Slimy marketing executive in the making.
