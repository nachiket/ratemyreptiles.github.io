## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5

## Review Summary
Reptile is a polite and survived the Waterloo hellscape minding their own
business. Reptile will find mistakes on slides :)

## Detailed Breakdown

- **Learning Style:** Hunched over their laptop, probably the only reptile in class actually understanding what is being explained.
- **Grades:** Will not chase grades but learning instead.
- **Industriousness:** Works like a crazy reptile like most Waterloo reptiles.
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** One of the few reptiles always asking probing questions in class.
- **Reptile Quality:** Basement warrior that will likely run the whole company on their own.
